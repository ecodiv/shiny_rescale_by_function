##  Visualization of rescale functions

Shiny dashboard to visualize the effect of different rescale functions and their parmeter settings.

Part of a spatial multicriteria decision analysis is to rescale the different criteria layers to a common scale of e.g., 0 to 1. In QGIS, this can be done using e.g., the fuzzify functions.

The problem, especially if you are not familiar with the different rescale functions, is to decide which parameter settings to use.

This app aims to provide a visual aid by allowing you to try out the different rescale functions and their parameter settings. In addition, you can compare to different combinations of functions and settings.

To try out the tool, see https://ecodivearth.shinyapps.io/rescale_by_function/. Note, this is very much work in progress. IF you encounter an error, please submit a bug report.

## Roadmap

Manual pages that explain the the different functions, including examples when they could be used. And possibly add extra functions.
