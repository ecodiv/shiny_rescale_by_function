##  Visualization of rescale functions

Shiny dashboard to visualize the effect of different rescale functions and their parmeter settings.

The tool aims to help users of the fuzzify functions in QGIS to get a better grip on what the different functions do, and how changing the parameters effect the results.

To try out the tool, see https://ecodivearth.shinyapps.io/rescale_by_function/. Note, this is very much work in progress. IF you encounter an error, please submit a bug report.
